How-To
------

1. use Audacity to create the file with the right settings: 8KHz, 8bit, mono. Do it with WAV export.
1. Audacity will always leave a tail, making the file suck big time. Therefore trim it with: sox fifiu.wav fifiu-cut.wav trim 0 10000s
1. Export it to text with: ./wav2c fifiu-cut.wav fifiu.h sounddata
